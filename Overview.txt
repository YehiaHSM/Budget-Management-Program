Budget Management Program Documentation
Overview
This C++ program is designed to help users manage their budget by recording income, expenses, and recurring costs. Users can input details, edit or delete entries, and obtain a net total along with a breakdown of income, expenses, and recurring costs.

Structures
Income
Structure to store information about income.
Fields:
Iname: Array to store the name of the income source (up to 25 characters).
Iamount: Integer to store the amount of income.
Expenses
Structure to store information about expenses.
Fields:
Ename: Array to store the name of the expense (up to 25 characters).
Eamount: Integer to store the amount of the expense.
Recurring
Structure to store information about recurring costs.
Fields:
Rname: Array to store the name of the recurring cost (up to 25 characters).
Ramount: Integer to store the amount of the recurring cost.
Main Function
Input Phase:

Users are prompted to input details for income, expenses, and recurring costs until they choose not to add more.
Editing Phase:

Users are given the option to edit or delete entries for income, expenses, and recurring costs.
Editing options include changing the name and amount of entries.
Output Phase:

The program displays a summary of income, expenses, recurring costs, and the net total.
If the net total is negative, a message suggests decreasing expenses or increasing income.
System Pause:

The system("pause") command is used to keep the console window open until the user presses a key.
Notes
The program uses arrays for storing data, and entries are manipulated based on user input.
Editing and deleting entries are provided as options to enhance user flexibility.
The net total is calculated as the difference between income and the sum of expenses and recurring costs.
